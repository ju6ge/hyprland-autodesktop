Hyprland Kanshi Bridge
======================

Kanshi is a tool for applying different monitor configurations when a different set of monitors are detected. Sadly it does not work great together with hyprland.
Hence this tool. It is supposed to be used together with kanshi via the exec parameter. Some extra feature are also here.
